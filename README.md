## About the workshop
**Who is this for**:
 - **If you already know how to code**: Try to setup a project with cursor and try to really take advantage of the composer mode without coding everything manually from scratch.
 - **If you are new to coding, or a complete beginner**: Either try to follow along. Or try to make a simple project with different tools (v0, replit... about that later)

 **Schedule**:
 * 30 min - intro
 * 60 min - project


# Projects
1. Data Processing and Visualization (web scrape data from the internet and visualize it - e.g. swimming pool visits)
2. Console/Graphical Game - Snake, minesweeper, ...
3. Real-time Face emotion detection using a laptop Camera


## Setup
If you haven't already: [install cursor](https://www.cursor.com/downloads)

1. Clone the repository `git clone git@github.com:hulmaker/ai-club.git`
2. Open the `ai-club` folder in Cursor

**General guidelines to follow**:
1. Describe the project (in the readme file, or in the notepad tab).
2. Describe the project environment, structure and tools wou would like to use.
3. Describe all the inputs, outputs and the overall process.
4. Imagine you are the project manager. You need to split the project into smaller parts. Your job is to describe all tasks and formulate what needs to be done.
5. Review the changes, update the descriptions and use all the tools to make changes so that the output is to your liking.
6. Repeat until you are done.


# Cursor Tour

### Editing modes:
 - [Tab](https://docs.cursor.com/tab/overview): Autocomplete that suggests edits and multi-line changes based on your recent work
 - [chat](https://docs.cursor.com/chat/overview): Uses AI to answer code questions with smart context and file references in your editor. [chat vs. composer confusion](https://forum.cursor.com/t/whats-the-difference-between-chat-and-composer/21879)
 - [composer](https://docs.cursor.com/composer): Coding assistant that helps write and edit code directly in your editor with chat and agent modes.
 - [agent](https://docs.cursor.com/agent): Uses tools and reasoning to perform coding tasks with minimal supervision

hierarchy: `tab < chat < composer < agent`

### Context:
 - Select a section of the code, then use `Edit` for quick editing, or `Chat` for setting the context in the chat.
 - Use `@` [symbols](https://docs.cursor.com/context/@-symbols/overview) to reference files, images, web pages, documentation, notebooks, or search the web!
 - Set [global/project rules](https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules-for-ai) for general guidelines, style, language, etc: 

### Other settings:
 - [Models](https://docs.cursor.com/settings/models): Select the model you want to use.
 - [MCP servers](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol): [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) - standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs

 ### Cursor related links, videos, etc:
 - [Cursor tips and tricks](https://youtu.be/A9BiNPf34Z4?si=sIdVXg2vnXbuKwb3)
 - [Cursor rules](https://github.com/PatrickJS/awesome-cursorrules)
 - [Cursor directory](https://cursor.directory)

## General prompting tips
 - Be specific about what you want to do, use clear instructions
 - Don't ask, provide instructions
 - Context is important. Provide examples, references, errors, etc...
