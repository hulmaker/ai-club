## About the workshop
**Who is this for**:
 - **If you already know how to code**: Try to setup a project with cursor and try to really take advantage of the composer mode without coding everything manually from scratch.
 - **If you are new to coding, or a complete beginner**: Either try to follow along. Or try to make a simple project with different tools (v0, replit... about that later)

 **Schedule**:
 * 30 min - intro
 * 60 min - project


# Projects
1. Data Processing and Visualization (web scrape data from the internet and visualize it - e.g. swimming pool visits)
2. Console/Graphical Game - Snake, minesweeper, ...
3. Real-time Face emotion detection using a laptop Camera


## Setup
If you haven't already: [install cursor](https://www.cursor.com/downloads)

1. Clone the repository `git clone git@github.com:hulmaker/ai-club.git`
2. Open the `ai-club` folder in Cursor
3. Create a virtual environment `python -m venv .env`
4. Activate the virtual environment `source .env/bin/activate`
5. Select the `.env` as an interpreter in Cursor `ctrl+shift+p > select interpreter`


1. Describe the project (in the readme file, or in the notepad tab) (HOW? Example)
2. Provide initial instructions - think about the building process and how would you start building it (Try to divide the project into smaller parts)
3. Iterate - ask the AI to do something, then provide feedback, ask it to do it again, etc.


# Cursor Tour

### Editing modes:
 - [Tab](https://docs.cursor.com/tab/overview): Autocomplete that suggests edits and multi-line changes based on your recent work
 - [chat](https://docs.cursor.com/chat/overview): Uses AI to answer code questions with smart context and file references in your editor. [chat vs. composer confusion](https://forum.cursor.com/t/whats-the-difference-between-chat-and-composer/21879)
 - [composer](https://docs.cursor.com/composer): Coding assistant that helps write and edit code directly in your editor with chat and agent modes.
 - [agent](https://docs.cursor.com/agent): Uses tools and reasoning to perform coding tasks with minimal supervision

hierarchy: `tab < chat < composer < agent`

### Context:
 - Select a section of the code, then use `Edit` for quick editing, or `Chat` for setting the context in the chat.
 - Use `@` [symbols](https://docs.cursor.com/context/@-symbols/overview) to reference files, images, web pages, documentation, notebooks, or search the web!
 - Set [global/project rules](https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules-for-ai) for general guidelines, style, language, etc: 

### Other settings:
 - [Models](https://docs.cursor.com/settings/models): Select the model you want to use.
 - [MCP servers](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol): [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) - standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs
