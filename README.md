## About the Workshop

### Who Is This For?

This workshop is designed for anyone interested in AI-assisted programming, whether you're an experienced coder looking to optimize your workflow or a beginner exploring new tools.

- **Experienced Coders** – Learn how to effectively use [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) and it’s composer mode to streamline your workflow instead of coding everything manually.
- **Beginners** – Follow along or use alternative tools (V0, Replit, etc.) to create simple projects—more details later.

### Schedule

- **30 min** – **Introduction**: Overview of AI-assisted programming, introduction to Cursor, and how to leverage AI tools effectively. We will go through an example of how to use Cursor to build a simple project.
- **60 min** – **Hands-on Project Work**: Instructions below (Part 2)

## Introduction to Cursor

### Editing Modes

- [**Tab**](https://docs.cursor.com/tab/overview) – Autocomplete with smart suggestions based on your recent work.
- [**Chat**](https://docs.cursor.com/chat/overview) – AI-assisted answers with file references.
- [**Composer**](https://docs.cursor.com/composer) – AI coding assistant for writing and editing.
- [**Agent**](https://docs.cursor.com/agent) – Performs coding tasks with minimal supervision.

**Hierarchy:** `Tab < Chat < Composer < Agent`

### Context Features

- Select code and use **Edit** for quick modifications or **Chat** for discussions.
- Use [**@ symbols**](https://docs.cursor.com/context/@-symbols/overview) to reference files, images, documentation, or search the web.
- Set [**Global/Project Rules**](https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules-for-ai) to establish coding style and conventions.

### Additional Settings

- [**Model Selection**](https://docs.cursor.com/settings/models) – Choose the AI model that best fits your needs.
- [**MCP Servers**](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol) – Standardized AI context protocol ([Learn More](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction)).

# Part 2: Hands-on Project Work

### Example Project Ideas
1. **Data Processing & Visualization** – Download/Scrape data from the internet and visualize it (or use sutka.log to analyze swimming pool visits).
2. **Console/Graphical Game** – Create a game like Snake or Minesweeper.
3. **Real-time Face Emotion Detection** – Use a laptop camera to detect facial expressions.
4. **Personalized To-Do List** – Build a simple to-do app with hidden features. (e.g. show a cat image when all tasks are completed)
5. **Weather App** – Fetch real-time weather data from an API and display it in a user-friendly interface.
4. **Other** – Any other project you want to work on.

## Setup Instructions

1. [Install Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/downloads) if you haven’t already.
2. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:hulmaker/ai-club.git
   ```
3. Open the `ai-club` folder in Cursor.

## Guidelines for Project Development

1. **Define Your Project** – Write a clear description in the README or Notepad tab outlining your goals.
2. **Specify the Environment and Tools** – Identify the programming languages, frameworks, and libraries required.
3. **Map Inputs and Outputs** – Determine what assets are needed and what results are expected.
4. **Break Down Tasks** – Structure the project into smaller, manageable tasks for better organization.
5. **Refine and Iterate** – Regularly review progress, update descriptions, and utilize AI tools for efficiency.
6. **Test and Finalize** – Ensure functionality, review the final implementation, and document any necessary changes.

Remember to try different approaches, editing modes and context settings with `@` symbols.

## Best Practices for AI Prompting

- Be **specific** about what you want the AI to do.
- Provide **clear instructions** instead of asking vague questions.
- Include **context** such as examples, references, or error messages.
